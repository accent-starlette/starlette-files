# Example

We have built a sample media library using this package that can be found in
our [boilerplate](https://github.com/accent-starlette/boilerplate) repo. The
branch is called `gallery` and can be launched in docker.

You will need to follow the readme to generate your migrations and create
a user. Then login and visit http://localhost/admin.
